# PoC Challenges

## Introduction

Wide World Importers (WWI) is in the process of building a new, modern analytics solution. Their existing analytics solution was created using an older, on-premises version of SQL Server and was based only on the relational engine. WWI's top management expects the new solution to support the strategic move towards near-real-time data analysis.

The core objective of this PoC challenge is to prove that Azure Synapse Analytics is the right platform to be used by the new solution.

## Completing the challenges

Work as a team to complete the challenges listed below. Please pay attention to each challenge's background story, as they contain insights into the customer's pain points and what they want to solve. Successful teams collaborate on understanding each challenge, then divide and conquer to work in parallel as much as possible.

You have the freedom to choose the solution your team believes will best fit WWI's needs. However, you must be able to explain the thought process behind the decisions to your coach.
